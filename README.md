# Apigee AppDynamics Agent Plugin

Apigee is a little tough to instrument. The
maintainers have gone to some extremes to keep this code a bit obfuscated. I do hope this plugin and the examples within may help reveal a bit about that implementation. Please let me know if anything is missing.

Thanks, John
